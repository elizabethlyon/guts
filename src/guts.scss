/*
If you prefer to compile guts.css along with your own sass project, use the _guts-source file in your project. Otherwise, if you prefer to use the .css file, you can grab guts.css or guts.min.css which are compiled from the _guts-source and included in this project for you to download and use.

This file has no other purpose than to assist in the ease of compiling the final .css files.
